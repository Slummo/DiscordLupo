Lupo | Discord music bot

A simple discord music bot built with discord.js

To use it first create an application at https://discord.com/developers/applications, then make the bot join
your server by getting the join URL in OAuth2 > URL generator (make sure to give the bot admin access).

Then create a "bot-config.json" file in the same folder as your main script and add these properties:
name: the bot name;
prefix: the string (or single character) with you want to use commands.
help: a list of commands to show if you are gonna implement a "help" command.

Finally install node.js and run the bot with the command "npm start".
